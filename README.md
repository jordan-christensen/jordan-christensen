# Howdy, Pilgrim 🏜️

I'm a software engineer from Washington, USA.

I focused on Frontend web development, but have built full-stack applications and dabbled in many other technologies from **Swift** and **Java** to **Rust** and **C++**.

To me, the pursuit of software engineering is a journey of learning, discovery, and progression. Ultimately, I aim to make challenging tasks easier, time-consuming processes more efficient, and to turn the previously impossible into the something achievable.
