# Howdy, Pilgrim üèúÔ∏è

I'm a software engineer from Washington, USA.

I am focused on Frontend web development (React is my jam), but have built full-stack applications and dabbled in many other technologies from **Swift** and **Java** to **Rust** and **C++**.

I don't know anybody else who loves CSS as much as I do.

(Come to think of it, I don't know many developers who love CSS at all!)

To me, the pursuit of software engineering is a journey of learning, discovery, and progression. Ultimately, I aim to make challenging tasks easier, time-consuming processes more efficient, and to turn the previously impossible into the something achievable.
