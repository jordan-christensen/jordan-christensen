# Howdy, Pilgrim 🏜️

I'm a software engineer from Washington, USA.

I am focused on Frontend web development (React is my jam), but have built full-stack applications and dabbled in many other technologies from **Swift** and **Java** to **Rust** and **C++**.

To me, the software engineering is a journey of learning, discovery, and progression.

Ultimately, I aim to make challenging things easier, time-consuming things more efficient, and previous impossible things *possible*.
